# 5) (Concept:Define a function).
# First, define a function called subtract that accepts two parameters and will subtract the second 
# parameter from the first. Secondly, call this function at least two times and plug in various numbers, and 
# print out the result both times. If your code doesn't work, try it in the python visualizer

def subtract(a, b): 
    answer = b - a
    return answer

result = subtract(8, 9)
print(result)

result1 = subtract(6,2)
print(result1)
